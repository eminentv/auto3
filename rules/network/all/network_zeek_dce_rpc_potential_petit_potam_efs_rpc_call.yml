  The usage of this RPC function should be rare if ever used at all.
  Thus usage of this function is uncommon enough that any usage of this RPC function should warrant further investigation to determine if it is legitimate.
   View surrounding logs (within a few minutes before and after) from the Source IP to. Logs from from the Source IP would include dce_rpc, smb_mapping, smb_files, rdp, ntlm, kerberos, etc..'
